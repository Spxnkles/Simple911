# Simple911
A plugin made primarily for Roleplay servers. When a player calls 911, the players with the 911 permission group will receive a notification that includes the closest location node of the caller, marks their position on the map with a waypoint, and can have a included message from the caller.

# Config
- MessageColor - You can choose the color of the message that 911 players get.
- SetWaypointOnCall - If set to true every player with the permission to receive 911 calls will have the callers location marked.
